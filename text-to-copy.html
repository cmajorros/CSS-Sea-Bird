<h3>Saunderlings Play on the Shore</h3>
<p>These small Sandpipers dodge the waves  at Zuma Beach in Malibu, California. </p>
<p>Saunderlings feed on the beach in flocks spread out in lines along the water's edge, usually arranged in groups of three or four. </p>
<p>They make a sharp, high kit sound and scurry very fast. </p>
